        <h1>~Why should you learn to code~</h1>
        <p>
          If you are a newcomer to the world of web development and coding, it
          makes the most sense to start by teaching yourself how to code so that
          you may discover what you do and don't like, before investing
          resources into courses for a particular coding language. Additionally,
          learning to code doesn't have to cost a fortune—some resources require
          low finacial investment to absolutely nothing. The job market for
          coding specialists and web developers is only getting larger, and top
          companies around the world are looking for the best and brightest
          minds to fill these positions. When approached right, you may even
          find that you will not even have to pay a dime to learn how to
          code—depending on your learning path. It is a skill that will never be
          overlooked by potential employers and is valuable.
